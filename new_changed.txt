Here is a summary of the recent changes made to the project:

1.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Resolved multiple `npm install` failures by correcting dependency conflicts with `genkit` packages.
    *   Aligned all `@genkit-ai/*` and related `firebase` packages to stable, compatible versions (v1.4.0).
    *   Added an `overrides` section to `package.json` to enforce these specific versions, preventing future conflicts from sub-dependencies.
    *   Installed missing packages required by UI components, including `embla-carousel-react` and `recharts`.
    *   Removed the deprecated `@types/handlebars` package to clean up installation warnings.
    *   Re-added the optional `@opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger` package to resolve a build-time module resolution error.

2.  **Code & TypeScript Fixes:**
    *   Corrected a TypeScript error in `src/app/admin/data/actions.ts` related to a function's type inference, which was preventing the project from building.
    *   Fixed a build error in `src/app/admin/users/page.tsx` by adding missing `name` properties to the mock user data, ensuring it matched the required `User` type.
    *   Resolved a type error in `src/app/admin/data/page.tsx` to prevent the app from trying to download "feedback" data as a master JSON file.
    *   Fixed an implicit `any[]` type error in `src/lib/data/service-schedules.ts` by providing an explicit `string[]` type for empty array declarations.
